   Participants: Profs. V.R. Jagannathan, K.K. Goswami, Thakur Dass and

 On the basis of the discussions, the following points emerged and the
 decisions talken:-

1.        A sequence of Adjective/Noun +Verb ( such as ïB³ÏÆÚ / ïBØåÆÚ
.may be presently treated as ïB³èÏÛÍÚÌŞÑ under the following conditions:-
     
	a) A sequence of derived adjectives (such as ÈÏÛÔÏèÂÛÂ, ¨Âè×ÚØÛÂ
etc) followed by '³ÏÆÚ/ØåÆÚ' ' type of verbs may be treated as a
'³èÏÛÍÚÌŞÑ'. '¤ÈÌÚÆÛÂ ³ÏÆÚ ', '¨Âè×ÚØÛÂ ³ÏÆÚ', 'ÈÏÛÔÏèÂÛÂ ³ÏÆÚ' are some
of the examples of this type.For example :

sent-1 : ¨Æ³á ºÜÔÆ Æá ÔÛÄèÍÚÏèÃÛÍå¢ ³å ÊØİÂ [¨Âè×ÚØÛÂ ³ÛÍÚ]
 
      NOTE : A sequence of root adjectives such as '¾Ü³', '¤¸è¹Ú',
      '×ÉáÄ' etc followed by '³ÏÆÚ/ØåÆÚ' may be left unmarked for the
      time being. They need further discussion before we arrive at any
      final decision on how these sequences need to be treated within
      our framework.

	b) A sequence of noun followed by verb ('³ÏÆÚ/ØåÆÚ' type) may be
marked as a 'verb' in case the sentence contains a noun which holds
the 'karma'(k2) relation with this collective unit. The noun holding
'k2' relation has to be distinct from the noun in the 'noun-karanA'
sequence. For example, if we take the sequence
'³èÖÌÚ ³ÏÆÚ' in the following sentence

sent-2 : ïBÏÚºÚ Æá ¤ÈÆá Ì¢ÂèÏÜ ³å ïB[³èÖÌÚ ³Ï ÄÛÍÚ]ê
 
sent-2 above has 'Ì¢ÂèÏÜ' as 'k2' which is distinct from the noun '³èÖÌÚ',
the noun which co-occurs with '³ÏÆÚ' in '³èÖÌÚ ³Ï ÄÛÍÚ' sequence.

sometimes the 'karma' in such constructions might be marked with the
vibhakti '³Ú/³á/³Ü'. Therefore, though the vibhakti might be '³Ú/³á/³Ü'
which normally marks a genitive relation, in such specific constructions
the drel of this noun unit has to be marked as 'k2'. For example :

sent-3 : ÏÚÌ Æá ÏÔÛ ³Ü ÈèÏÂÜ³èÖÚ ³Ü
sent-4 : ³ÚÏèÍÕÚÑÚ ³á ÑÛÍá 25 Ñåµå¢ ³Ú ÆÚÌÚ¢³Æ ³ÛÍÚ µÍÚ 

In the above examples, 'ÏÔÛ' in sent-3 and '25 Ñåµå¢' in S4 hold 'karma'
relation with the respective verbs 'ÈèÏÂÜ³èÖÚ ³Ü' and 'ÆÚÌÚ¢³Æ ³ÛÍÚ
µÍÚ'. Therefore, they have to be marked as 'k2' and not as 'r6'.

	c) A test that can be applied to confirm the status of such
sequences as a verb is to see whether the unit can take an adverb

	d)   A sequence of noun followed by verb, for example, ' snAna 
karanA' may also be treated as  a kriyAmUla in case there is no distinct
'k2' in the sentence. Following syntactic test may be applied to confirm
the sequence as a single verbal unit.
       Try a pariticpial construction using the unit as a verb. Eg

	sent-5(a) : ¦× ¤Ô×Ï ÈÏ ³§ Ñåµå¢ Æá ³ÚÌ ³ÛÍÚ	
	sent-5(b) : ¦× ¤Ô×Ï ÈÏ ³§ Ñåµå¢ ÄèÔÚÏÚ ³ÛÍá µÍá ³ÚÌ ÊØİÂ È×ÆèÄ ³ÛÍá µÍá

	sent-6(a) : ³İÌèË Ìá¢ ³§ ÑÚ´ Ñåµå¢ Æá ×èÆÚÆ ³ÛÍÚ
	*sent-6(b) : ³İÌèË Ìá¢ ³§ ÑÚ´ Ñåµå¢ ÄèÔÚÏÚ ³ÛÍá µÍá ×èÆÚÆ ½Ü.ÔÜ. ÈÏ ÄÛ´ÚÍá µÍá.		

               
2.         Expressions such as 'ïB³ÑÚÂèÌ³ ÔÛ³Ú× ³ÛÍÚ Øâ' in the sentence
'¦× ÄÛÕÚ Ìá¢ ¨ÆèØå¢Æá ¤ÈÆÜ ÈèÏÂÛËÚ ³Ú ³ÑÚÂèÌ³ ÔÛ³Ú× ³ÛÍÚ Øâ' should be
analysed in the following way. 'ÔÛ³Ú× ³ÛÍÚ' may be treated as a verb
since 'ÈèÏÂÛËÚ' is a disticnt 'k2' of 'Ô³Ú× ³ÛÍÚ Øâ'. Once 'ÔÛ³Ú× ³ÛÍÚ
Øâ' is established as a verb, one needs to mark the appropriate relation
of '³ÑÚÂèÌ³' with 'ÔÛ³Ú×'. Although '³ÑÚÂèÌ³' is an adjective, in  this
context it is fucntioning as an adverb and has to be thus marked. The
underlying sense of '³ÑÚÂèÌ³' is '³ÑÚÂèÌ³ ÏŞÈ ×á'.

Current entry:

(( VG
ïB³ÑÚÂèÌ³

Corrections to be made:

sent-tep 1
sent-eparate ïB³ÑÚÂèÌ³ from the rest of the VG.  Thus

((

))
((
ïBÔÛ³Ú× ³ÛÍÚ Øâ
))

sent-tep 2 
Mark nodes for the separated chunks.

(( RBP

(( VG

ïB³ÛÍÚ Øâ 
))

sent-tep 3
Establish relations between the chunks.

3. The relations between two nouns can be of the following type :

a) Genitive : which may occur with an explicit vibhakti 'kA/ke/kI'.
For example : ÌáÏá ÈÛÂÚ ³Ü Äİ³ÚÆ, ÏÚºÚ ³Ú Êá½Ú 

The genitive has to be marked by giving value 'r6' for the attribute
'drel'. ÌáÏá ÈÛÂÚ ³Ü/r6 Äİ³ÚÆ,  ÏÚºÚ ³Ú/r6 Êá½Ú

b) The two nouns may also have a 'part and whole' relation. For example,

   sent-7 : ¥º ÕÚÌ ×ÚÂ Êºá ¥ÆÚ

In the above example each of the elements '¥º, ÕÚÌ' and '×ÚÂ' is a
time expression. However, together they form one large time expression
wherein they are related to each other in terms of 'part-whole'. '¥º'
is the largest unit and '×ÚÂ Êºá' the smallest of the larger time
expression ¥º ÕÚÌ ×ÚÂ Êºá.  sent-uch relations have to be marked in the
following way:


(( NP	<drel=k7t:1/ name=2>
¥º
))
(( NP	<drel=r6:2/name=3>
ÕÚÌ
))
(( NP	<drel=r6:3>
×ÚÂ
Êºá
))
(( VG	<name=1>
¥ÆÚ
))

Here the expression '¥º ÕÚÌ ×ÚÂ Êºá' is the '³ÚÑ ¤ÅÛ³ÏÁ' of the verb
'¥ÆÚ' which is expressed by marking 'k7t' against the head of the
totaltime expression. The relation of the elements within the expression
is marked by 'r6' sent-uch a part and whole relation may have an explicit
vibhakti other than '³Ú/³á/³Ü'. For example:

sent-8 : ØÌÚÏá ¶Ï Ìá¢ Ï×å§ Ìá¢ ºŞÂá ÆØÜ¢ ºÚÂá

(( NP	<drel=k7p:1/name=2>
ØÌÚÏá
¶Ï
Ìá¢
))
(( NP	<drel=r6:2/name=3>
Ï×å§
Ìá¢
))
(( NP	<drel=k1>
ºŞÂá
))
(( VG	<name=1>
ÆØÜ¢
ºÚÂá
))

In the above example, though '¶Ï' and 'Ï×å§' have vibhakti 'Ìá¢' the
relation of 'Ï×å§' to '¶Ï' is that of 'r6' as 'Ï×å§' is a part of the
larger place expression '¶Ï'. Therefore, it has been marked as r6.

4.      The anaphora  is not to be marked at this level. For example -

        sent-9 : ïBÌáÏÚ ËÚ§ ÄÛÑèÑÜ ×á ¥ ÏØÚ Øâ ±Ï ÔØ ÍØÚ¡ ÂÜÆ ÄÛÆ ÏØáµÚ ê

In this example, we do not mark any relationship between ïBÌáÏÚ ËÚ§ and
ïBÔØ or ïBÄÛÑèÑÜ andïB ÍØÚ¡ ê However, in case of relative clauses, the
relationship between the noun and its relativized noun has to be marked.
For example
                 
	sent-10 : ÌáÏÚ ËÚ§ ºå ÄÛÑèÑÜ ×á ¥ ÏØÚ Øâ, ÍØÚ¡ ÂÜÆ ÄÛÆ ÏØáµÚ ê

(( NP  <name:1>
ïBÌáÏÚ 
ïBËÚ§
))
(( NP  <coref=1>
ïBºå
))

some more examples:

	sent-11 : ¦Æ ÊÚ¡×İÏÛÍå¢ Ìá¢ Ìİ´Ï¢ÅèÏ ïBï0­×á ×èÙÃÚÆå¢ ïBï0ÈÏ ÊÆÚÂá
              Øâ¢ ïBï0ºØÚ¡ ïBï0ÊÚ¡× ³Ü µÚ¡¾ ØåÂÜ Øâ ê 

(( NP <name:1>
ïB­×á 
ïB×èÙÃÚÆå¢ïBï0 
ïBÈÏ
))
(( NP  <coref=1>
ïBºØÚ¡
))


5.   ïB³Ü ¤Èá³èÖÚ, ³Ü ÂİÑÆÚ Ìá¢, ³á ºâ×Ú etc., may be marked ïB as K*u
(where the value of * may be k1 or k2, as he case may be. ïB³á ×ÚÃ,
³á ¤ÑÚÔÚ etc. may be marked as 'ras'.

6.   Discourse connectors (BLK) ïB¦×ÜÑÛ¬, ¦× ÔÛ¸ÚÏ ×á, ÈèÏÚÍ: etc.should
be shown a relationshiop with the sentence with which they occur.
The head of the sentence will have a "ccof" relation with the conjunct.

   6 a) Ìâ¢Æá ³ØÚ ³Û ÔØ ÈÚ× Øå ºÚ¬µÚ

   6 b)    CC (that,so that etc.)
           |
       ccof|
           | 
	ÈÚ× Øå ºÚ¬µÚ

   6 c) 
	(( NP
	Ìâ¢Æá
	))
	(( VG	<name=1>
	³ØÚ
	))
	(( BLK	<name=2/drel=k2:1>
	³Û
	))
	(( NP
	ÔØ
	))
	(( VG	<drel=ccof:2>
	ÈÚ×
	Øå
	ºÚ¬µÚ
	))

7. Coordinate constructions (CC) ïB±Ï, ÂÃÚ, ³Û, ÂÚ³Û etc.  are to be
marked 'ccof' in the following way: 
          
    7 a) Ìâ¢ ÊÚºéÚÏ µÍÚ ±Ï Ôá Ñåµ ¶Ï ÈÏ Ïİ³á

    7 b)  CC (and, but etc.)  
          /\  
     ccof/  \ ccofïB    
        /    \
      µÍÚ    Ïİ³á

    7 c)


	(( NP

	(( NP

	))
	(( VG	<drel=ccof:1>
	µÍÚ
	))
	(( BLK	<name=1>
	±Ï
	))
	(( NP	
	ÔØ
	Ñåµ
	))
	(( NP
	¶Ï
	ÈÏ
	))
	(( VG	<drel=ccof:1>
	Ïİ³á
	))


8.      sometimes the previously given labels at the POS level or at the
chunk level might be marked wrongly. Thus, it may require a change in
the labelling. For instance, take sentence sent-12 below
   
	sent-12 : ïBÔØ ×ÚÅÚÏÁ ×á ×ÚÅÚÏÁ Ô×èÂİ Ìá¢ ÔÛÕÛÖè½ µİÁå¢ ³Ü
	      ïBï0ï2[³ÑèÈÆÚ ³åïBï0ï]]/NP [ïBï0ï2×Ú³ÚÏ ³ÏÆá ³Ü]/NPïBï2
	      ïBï2¸áÖè½Ú Ìá¢ïBï0ï2 ÑµÚ ê

In sent-12 above '³ÑèÈÆÚ ³å' and '×Ú³ÚÏ ³ÏÆá ³Ü' are marked as NPs. Although
'×Ú³ÚÏ ³ÏÆá ³Ü' is a nominal form and is also functioning like one,
it is derived from a verb and it takes its arguments like any other
verb. In fact '³ÑèÈÆÚ ³å' is 'k2' of '×Ú³ÚÏ ³ÏÆá ³Ü'. In order to 
capture this relation we have to mark '×Ú³ÚÏ ³ÏÆá ³Ü' as a VG. Thus the
current annotation will be changed to

	sent-12 b : ÔØ ×ÚÅÚÏÁ ×á ×ÚÅÚÏÁ Ô×èÂİ Ìá¢ ÔÛÕÛÖè½ µİÁå¢ ³Ü


	ïBï0ï2[³ÑèÈÆÚ ³åïBï0ï]]/NP [ïBï0ï2×Ú³ÚÏ ³ÏÆá ³Ü]/VGïBï2
	ïBï2¸áÖè½Ú Ìá¢ïBï0ï2 ÑµÚ ê
